<sref ref="[depr.c.headers]"/> p3 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[<i>Example</i>: The header <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt> assuredly provides its declarations and definitions within the namespace
<tt>std</tt>. It may also provide these names within the global namespace. The header <tt>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</tt> assuredly
provides the same declarations and definitions within the global namespace, much as in the C Standard. It
may also provide these names within the namespace <tt>std</tt>. &mdash; <i>end example</i>]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This suggests that <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt> may provide <tt>::abs(long)</tt> and <tt>::abs(long long)</tt>. But this seems like 
it might contradict the normative wording of <sref ref="[headers]"/> p4:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Except as noted in Clauses 18 through 30 and Annex D, the contents of each header <tt>c<em>name</em></tt> shall be the same
as that of the corresponding header <tt><em>name</em>.h</tt>, as specified in the C standard library (1.2) or the C Unicode
TR, as appropriate, as if by inclusion. In the C++ standard library, however, the declarations (except for
names which are defined as macros in C) are within namespace scope (3.3.6) of the namespace <tt>std</tt>. It is
unspecified whether these names are first declared within the global namespace scope and are then injected
into namespace <tt>std</tt> by explicit using-declarations (7.3.3).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Note that this allows <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt> to provide <tt>::abs(int)</tt>, but does not obviously allow <tt>::abs(long)</tt> 
nor <tt>::abs(long long)</tt>, since they are not part of the header <tt>stdlib.h</tt> as specified in the C standard library.
<p/>
<sref ref="[c.math]"/> p7 adds signatures <tt>std::abs(long)</tt> and <tt>std::abs(long long)</tt>, but not in a way that seems 
to allow <tt>::abs(long)</tt> and <tt>::abs(long long)</tt> to be provided.
<p/>
I think the right approach here would be to allow <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt> to either provide no <tt>::abs</tt> declaration, or 
to provide all three declarations from namespace <tt>std</tt>, but it should not be permitted to provide only <tt>int abs(int)</tt>. 
Suggestion:
<p/>
Change in <sref ref="[headers]"/> p4:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[&hellip;]. It is unspecified whether these names <ins>(including any overloads added in Clauses 18 through 30 and Annex D)</ins> 
are first declared within the global namespace scope and are then injected into namespace <tt>std</tt> by explicit using-declarations 
(7.3.3).
</p></blockquote>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3936.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[headers]"/> p4 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Except as noted in Clauses 18 through 30 and Annex D, the contents of each header <tt>c<em>name</em></tt> shall be the same
as that of the corresponding header <tt><em>name</em>.h</tt>, as specified in the C standard library (1.2) or the C Unicode
