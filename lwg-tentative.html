<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>
<p>
In an <tt>emplace</tt> member function the function parameter pack may be bound
to a priori unlimited number of objects: some or all of them can be
elements of the container itself. Apparently, in order to conform to the
blanket statement 23.2 [container.requirements]/11, the
implementation must check all of them for that possibility. A possible
solution can involve extending the exception in 23.2 [container.requirements]/12 also to the emplace member. As a
side note, the <tt>push_back</tt> and <tt>push_front</tt> member
functions are luckily not affected by this problem, can be efficiently
implemented anyway.

LWG believes that <a href="lwg-active.html#2164">2164</a> addresses this issue and therefore considers <a href="lwg-active.html#760">760</a> as NAD.

<p><b>Proposed resolution:</b></p>
<p>
Add after 23.2 [container.requirements]/12:

<blockquote>
<p>
-12- Objects passed to member functions of a container as rvalue
references shall not be elements of that container. No diagnostic
required.
</p>
<p>

-13- Objects bound to the function parameter pack of the
<tt>emplace</tt> member function shall not be elements or sub-objects of
elements of the container. No diagnostic required.

<h3><a name="2224"></a>2224. Ambiguous status of access to non-live objects</h3>
<p><b>Section:</b> 17.6.4.10 [res.on.objects] <b>Status:</b> <a href="lwg-active.html#Ready">Tentatively Ready</a>
 <b>Submitter:</b> Geoffrey Romer <b>Opened:</b> 2012-12-17 <b>Last modified:</b> 2015-05-05</p>
<p><b>View all other</b> <a href="lwg-index.html#res.on.objects">issues</a> in [res.on.objects].</p>
<p><b>Discussion:</b></p>

<p>
The standard currently does not discuss when library objects may be accessed, except in a non-normative 
note pertaining to synchronization in [res.on.objects], leaving it ambiguous whether single-threaded 
code can access a library object during its construction or destruction. For example, there is a 
reasonable question as to what happens if the deleter supplied to a <tt>unique_ptr</tt> transitively 
accesses the <tt>unique_ptr</tt> itself during <tt>unique_ptr</tt>'s destruction; a straightforward 
reading suggests that this is permitted, and that the deleter will see the <tt>unique_ptr</tt> still 
holding the originally stored pointer, but consensus on the LWG reflector indicates this was not the 
intent (see discussion beginning with 
<a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=33362">c++std-lib-33362</a>).
</p>

<p><i>[2013-03-15 Issues Teleconference]</i></p>

<p>
Moved to Open.
</p>
<p>
Geoffrey will provide an example that clearly highlights the issue.
</p>

<p><i>[2013-03-19 Geoffrey provides revised resolution and an example]</i></p>


<p>
I contend that the most straightforward reading of the current standard requires the following example code to print 
"good" (because <tt>~unique_ptr</tt> is not specified to modify the state of the internal pointer), but the consensus 
on the reflector was that its behavior should be undefined.
<p/>
This example also shows that, contrary to a comment in the telecon, the PR is not tautological. 12.7 [class.cdtor]/p4 
explicitly permits member function calls during destruction, so the behavior of this code is well-defined as far as 
the core language is concerned, despite the fact that it accesses a library object after the end of the object's 
lifetime. If we want this code to have undefined behavior, we need to specify that at the library level.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;memory&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class A;

struct B {
 std::unique_ptr&lt;A&gt; a;
};

struct A {
 B* b;
 ~A() {
   if (b-&gt;a.get() == this) {
     std::cout &lt;&lt; "good" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
   }
 }
};

int main() {
 B b;
 b.a.reset(new A);
 b.a-&gt;b = &amp;b;
}

STL: is this resolved by our change to the reeentrancy rules? [LWG <a href="lwg-active.html#2414">2414</a>]<br/>
GR: don't think that solves the multi-threaded case<br/>
MC: I like changing the note to normative text<br/>
GR: uses the magic "happens before" words, and "access" is magic too<br/>
JW: I like this. strict improvement, uses the right wording we have to say this properly<br/>

<p>
AM: This ship has sailed. JM: What's the issue? AM: <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> has narrow contract and should never have had 
<tt>noexcept</tt>. DK: Not quite. We explicitly called out that for <tt>shared_ptr</tt> this is fine. You said so in your 
"narrow contract" paper. GR: This would be a fairly major regression in the design of {<tt>unique</tt>,<tt>shared</tt>}<tt>_ptr</tt> 
over raw pointers; raw pointer dereferencing is <tt>noexcept</tt>. It's not a performance regression but a usability regression. 
AM: Do we expect users to query <tt>noexpect</tt> on dereference expressions? Room: Yes. VV: We don't just expect it, we have 
seen it. JM: Yes, users may be querying something like <tt>noexcept(x-&gt;y)</tt> and expect to be checking <tt>y</tt>, but 
silently end up checking <tt>x-&gt;</tt>. 
<p/>
Close as NAD, with explanation from GR.

<p><i>[2015-03-03, Geoffrey provides rationale]</i></p>

<p>
<b>Rationale</b>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
It is by design that these members are <tt>noexcept</tt>, and changing that now would be a substantial regression in functionality. 
These classes were designed to substitute for plain pointers as transparently as possible, so since those operations are effectively 
<tt>noexcept</tt> on plain pointers, they should be <tt>noexcept</tt> on <tt>unique_ptr</tt> and <tt>shared_ptr</tt> as well. 
This matters in practice because we expect these members to be used fairly often inside the <tt>noexcept</tt> operator, and such 
code could be broken by this change. These design considerations override our general policy against <tt>noexcept</tt> for 
narrow-contract functions.
<p/>
It is notable that N3279, which proposed this policy, did not propose striking <tt>noexcept</tt> from these operations. It's not 
clear if the omission of <tt>operator*</tt> and <tt>operator-&gt;</tt> was an oversight, or an intentional reflection of the above 
considerations. N3279 was based on N3248 by the same authors, which states that:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
"Most applications of <tt>noexcept</tt> for <tt>unique_ptr</tt> and <tt>shared_ptr</tt> are on functions with wide contracts. 
However, there are preconditions on the atomic access functions, so these should lose the specification."
</p>
