30.4.1.3.1 [thread.timedmutex.class] says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The class <tt>timed_mutex</tt> shall satisfy all of the <tt>TimedMutex</tt> requirements (30.4.1.3 [thread.timedmutex.requirements]). 
It shall be a standardlayout class (Clause 9 [class]).
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Problem here is that 30.4.1.3 [thread.timedmutex.requirements] does not define a requirement set named &quot;<tt>TimedMutex</tt>&quot;,
it only refers to &quot;<i>timed mutex types</i>&quot;
</p>

<p><i>[See also issue <a href="lwg-active.html#2126">2126</a>]</i></p>


<p><i>[2012, Portland: move to Tentatively NAD Editorial]</i></p>

<p>
We have timed mutex type, but it is labeled timed mutex requirements
</p>
<p>
We can make a suggestion, but will send to the editor as it seems purely editorial.
There is a typo, and we don't have the timed mutex but 30.4.1.3 [thread.timedmutex.requirements] already
says timed mutex type, and we need to reuse that term down in the class to fulfil the mutex requirement.
</p>
<p><i>[To Editor:]</i></p>

<p>
Replace this one with timed mutex type.

<p>
 30.4.1.2.1 [thread.mutex.class]&#47;3 says that the class mutex "shall satisfy all the <tt>Mutex</tt> requirements (30.4.1 [thread.mutex.requirements])". 
 30.4.1.2.1 [thread.mutex.class] is part of 30.4.1 [thread.mutex.requirements], so at the very least, this 
 requirement is recursive. But worse, there is nothing that says what "the <tt>Mutex</tt> requirements" refers to. For example, 
 the "<tt>Lockable</tt> requirements" section starts with "A type <tt>L</tt> meets the <tt>Lockable</tt> requirements if &hellip;". There is no such 
 statement for "the <tt>Mutex</tt> requirements".
<p/>
Organizationally, paragraphs 1-26 in 30.4.1.2 [thread.mutex.requirements.mutex] should probably be in a subclause with a name. 
(This is actually an ISO requirement, to avoid exactly this kind of ambiguous referencing) Then the first sentence of 
30.4.1.2.1 [thread.mutex.class]&#47;3 can become a note: "The class mutex meets the requirements of (whatever)", since that 
subclause already says that the mutex types "shall meet the requirements set out in this section."
<p/>
And similarly for 30.4.1.2.2 [thread.mutex.recursive]&#47;2 (<tt>recursive_mutex</tt>).
<p/>
30.4.1.3 [thread.timedmutex.requirements], Timed mutex types, also needs the same rearrangement: its introductory 
requirements should be moved into a subclause, and the first sentences of 30.4.1.3.1 [thread.timedmutex.class]&#47;2 
and 30.4.1.3.2 [thread.timedmutex.recursive]&#47;2 should be turned into notes that refer to this new subclause and 
to the new subclause in 30.4.1.2 [thread.mutex.requirements.mutex].

<p>
Seems no real ambiguity. May need some reorg of text rather then changing the wording.
</p>
<p>
Is there much that needs to be changed? But Pete's suggestion of putting requirement in separate sub section is good.
Should be the direction to editor.
</p>
<p>
Suggest this is an editorial change. Happy with Pete's comments.

30.4.1.2 [thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]&#47;11 says that prior unlock operations <em>synchronize with</em> <tt>m.lock()</tt>.
<p/>
30.4.1.2 [thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]&#47;19 says that if <tt>m.try_lock()</tt> succeeds, prior unlock operations 
<em>synchronize with</em> the operation. 
<p/>
30.4.1.2 [thread.mutex.requirements.mutex]&#47;25 says that <tt>m.unlock()</tt> <em>synchronizes with</em> subsequent 
successful lock operations. 
<p/>
Does the third requirement add anything to the first two? If not, it should probably be a non-normative note.
</p>

<p><i>[2012, Portland: move to Tentatively NAD Editorial]</i></p>

<p>
Agree that third note should be non-normative and adds nothing.
</p>
<p>
Seems An Editorial change, but does changing a normative to non-normative wording makes it a non-editorial change?
</p>
<p>
Ask the editor. If not editorial, then we will agree on the fix as removal of the third point,
then we will put it in ready state for Bristol.
